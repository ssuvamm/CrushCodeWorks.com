## Challenge
The previous website looked modern but converted poorly and loaded slowly in key geographies.

## Solution
We shipped a static-first Astro front-end with highly targeted interaction layers and revised information hierarchy.

## Results
- 42% increase in qualified demos
- 58% faster Largest Contentful Paint
- 31% lower bounce rate on high-intent pages
